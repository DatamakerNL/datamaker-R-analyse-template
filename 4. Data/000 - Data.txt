4. Data

This folder should contain all the data required to run the project.
Data can also be saved here, but it should be clear that if this folder is filled everything can be reproduced.

Be sure to annotate data with the data of retrieval yyyymmdd_datafile.csv.
This way the data can always be traced back to a certain date
